        <p title="About me :)"; style="color:rgb(242, 255, 0)">My name is Michael Rogowski.
            I was born and raised in Streetsboro, Ohio, and I went to Streetsboro High School.
            I've enjoyed building and creating things my whole life, and I'm excited to be in a major that helps me hone in or that and better my skills to create bigger and better things.
            I have an older sister and two younger brothers.
            No pets, four kids was enough for my mom.</p>
